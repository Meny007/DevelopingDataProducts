There were 3 testers used and 10 parts measured 3 times in each tester.\n\nThe intention is to show the user at this point what the tool is accomplishing.\n\n\n--- .class #id \n\n## Dataset Example\n\nHere is how the data needs to be set and collected:\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\ntestDat<-read.csv(\"E:/DataScienceSpecialization/9_DevelopingDataProducts/Week4/test1/testResults.csv\")\nhead(testDat[,1:7],15)\n```\n\n\n---.class #id\n\n## User Interface and Output\n\nThe user will choose the parameter of interest that was tested.\n\nIn the output there are 2 tabs:\n\n1. The ANOVA and Gage R&R output from actual results\n\n2. The tab with the relevant plots.\n\n---.class #id\n\n## Project Data\n\nAnova Gage R&R Tool links:\n\nGITHUB - [ui.R and server.R codes](https://github.com/Meny007/DevelopingDataProducts)\n\nGage R&R Tool - [LINK](https://menynh.shinyapps.io/gageRRcalc/)",
